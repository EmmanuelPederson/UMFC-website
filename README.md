The framework for the University of Michigan Fencing Club's new website.
The new website is a static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and uses a [modified version](https://github.com/UM-Fencing/hugo-theme-bootie-docs) of the [Bootie Docs](http://themes.gohugo.io/bootie-docs/) theme.

This is very much in development and does not yet work as expected. If you're looking for the working version of the site, please visit [https://umich.edu/~fencing]().
